  <div id="diet">
    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>Brown bears are omnivorous animals with a diverse diet. They primarily feed on plant material, including berries, roots, and grasses. During the salmon spawning season, brown bears in coastal regions rely heavily on fish as a food source. They are also known to scavenge
      for carrion and occasionally hunt small mammals.</p>
    <p>These bears have a keen sense of smell, which helps them locate food from great distances. Their diet varies depending on the season and location, making them adaptable foragers.</p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <h3>Social Structure</h3>
    <p>Brown bears are typically solitary animals, but they are not strictly solitary and can be seen together in areas with abundant food sources. Female bears, known as sows, may be seen with their cubs, while male bears, known as boars, are often solitary.</p>
    <h3>Hibernation</h3>
    <p>During the winter months, brown bears enter a state of hibernation to conserve energy when food is scarce. They can hibernate for several months, relying on their fat reserves. Their body temperature and metabolic rate drop significantly during this period.</p>
